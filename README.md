## Overview

As simple as it may look, this project was difficult, to say the least.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

As usual, I started with structuring my HTML and then proceeded to CSS. There were a few times I had to return to the HTML file to change or add something.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit during this challenge. For example, I learned how to display an image over another image using the hover pseudo class.

```css
.container:hover .overlay{
    opacity: 0.8;
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to work more with transitions.

### Useful resources

- [Pro Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Himo9n0BaDw) - This helped me with the image hover effect.
